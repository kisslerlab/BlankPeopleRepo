# Manuscripts

This folder is for manuscript drafts. I recommend starting a new sub-folder for each new manuscript. Also, it's helpful to label the drafts in the following way: 

__Lastname_ShortTitle_YYYY-MM-DD.pdf__

And then, once you circulate the manuscript for edits, it's useful to append the initials of the person who's edited them: 

__Lastname_ShortTitle_YYYY-MM-DD_SK_AL.pdf__

Looks ugly, but I promise it's useful!
